Gradually, student&rsquo;s skills at chess and English improved. They developed greater expertise in the game and Bill took them to chess match in schools out of the neighborhood. Bill&rsquo;s dream grew and with sponsorship by Manhattan Chess Club, he took them to the State Finals in Syracuse. The twelve different boys transformed from lonely, inactive, and unconcerned to people handling their own life. They finished third in the State Finals, eligible for the National Finals in California. With sponsor from Pepsi-Cola, he took them to Russia&rsquo;s Scholastic Chess Friendship Games after meeting the Russian World Champion.
