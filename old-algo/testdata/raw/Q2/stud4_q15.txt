Bill had set up a chess club in order to bond the students and help them learn English. He got permission from the principal to start a chess club though everyone doubted them. The students improved at both chess and English. Bill took them to chess matches outside Spanish Harlem, paying for their expenses. Bill gave these boys the wholehearted attention and they knew it. However, everyone discouraged him to devoting so much time and effort thinking that they would not make it. The team proposed to travel to Russia for the Scholastic Chess Friendship Games. Bill approached a few sponsors for travel money but no one thought his team could win. Finally Pepsi-Cola produced a $20,000 check. In Moscow, their confidence fell, they had never met such opponents before. The Knights won a few matches and had an advantage over their opponents in speed chess as the Knights had a street-smart style that made them both fast and accurate.
