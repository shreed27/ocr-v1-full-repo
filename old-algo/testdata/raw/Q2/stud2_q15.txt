					While looking for an interest to bind one such group together and help them learn English at the same time, Bill noticed someone in the neighbourhood carrying a chessboard.

					As a chess player himself, he knew this game transcends cultural boundaries, 
			
			
				
					 
			
		
		
			
				
					3
			
			
				
					and so he got permission from a very skeptical principal to start a chess club

					It worked, and gradually, despite their friends and parents doubting them, the students&rsquo; skills at both chess and English improved. They developed greater expertise in the game, and Bill took them to chess matches in schools outside Spanish Harlem, paying for their subway fares and pizza dinners, no meagre sum on his teacher&rsquo;s salary,

					and the boys knew he cared, and they began to trust their teacher and believe in him. Bill was giving these boys something rare in their lives: the wholehearted attention of someone who believed in them.

					As they became better students and chess players, Bill Hall&rsquo;s dreams for them grew. With a little funding supplied by the Manhattan Chess Club, he enrolled, inspired and took them to the State Finals in Syracuse.  ......
				
					Upon finishing third in the State Finals, they were now eligible for the Junior High School National Finals in California.

					What had been twelve disparate, isolated, often passive, disinterested kids had now been transformed into a team with their own chose name: The Royal Knights. 
				
					 
			
			
				
					 
			
		
		
			
				
					8
			
			
				
					By now, disappointingly, even Bill&rsquo;s own colleagues were giving him reasons why he shouldn&rsquo;t be devoting so much time and effort. In real life, these ghetto kids would never "get past New Jersey," as one teacher pronounced. Why raise funds to fly them across the country and render them more dissatisfied with their lives? 
				
					Nonetheless, Bill raised the money for tickets to California. In that national competition, they finished seventeenth out of 109 teams.

					By now, chess has become a subject of interest in the school.
			
			
				
					 
			
		
		
			
				
					10
			
			
				
					On one of their days at a New York chess club, the team members encountered a young girl from the Soviet Union who was the Women&rsquo;s World Champion.

					Their confidence began to falter badly. The experience and deliberate style of their Soviet opponents were something they had never previously encountered.
			
			
				
					 
			
		
		
			
				
					18
			
			
				
					One of the Knights broke the spell by playing a Soviet Grand Master in his thirties into a draw in a simulation match. The Russians were not invincible after all.
