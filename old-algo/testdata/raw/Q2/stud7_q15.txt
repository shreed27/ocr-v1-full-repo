	Bill had set up a chess club in order to bond students together and help improve their English. He knew this game transcends cultural boundaries, so he obtained permission to start a chess club. The students developed great expertise in the game, so Bill brought them to chess matches out of their neighborhood. He also gave them his devoted attention and faith.  With funding from the Manhattan Chess Club, he prepared them for the State Finals, where they finished third, also qualifying for the Junior High School National Finals in California. Bill raised the money for tickets to California and in that national competition; they finished seventeenth out of 109 teams. No U.S. players their age had ever entered these games, but officials in Bill&rsquo;s school district rallied round the idea of entering the Scholastic Chess Friendship Games in Russia. Hence, Bill approached certain corporations for funding and Pepsi-Cola agreed to sponsor $20,000, bringing them to the international spotlight.
