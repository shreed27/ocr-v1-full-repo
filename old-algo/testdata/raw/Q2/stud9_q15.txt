Bill had set up a chess club in order to rid of cultural barriers. Through this, students&rsquo; skill at chess and English improved. He then took them to chess matches outside after they improved and paid attention to them. Bill took them to the State Finals in Syracuse under the team name, &lsquo;the royal knights,&rsquo; which symbolised their transformation from the once passive kids. Upon finishing third, they were qualified for the National finals, however, many were doubtful. Despite that, Bill raised funds for the team and eventually came in seventeenth. After meeting the Women&rsquo;s world champion, they were inspired to go to Russia to participate in the games. Officials and a few corporations, which Bill approached for travel money, considered the idea. Though they were not expected to win, the aim was to widen the team&rsquo;s scope. When Pepsi-Cola gave a $20,000 check, Bill&rsquo;s dream slowly became reality.
