	2 .  As a chess player himself, he knew this game transcends cultural boundaries, and so he got permission from a very skeptical principal to start a chess club.   

	3 . It worked, and gradually, despite their friends and parents doubting them, the students&rsquo; skills at both chess and English improved. They developed greater expertise in the game, and Bill took them to chess matches in schools outside Spanish Harlem, paying for their subway fares and pizza dinners, no meagre sum on his teacher&rsquo;s salary.

	4 . and the boys knew he cared, and they began to trust their teacher and believe in him. Bill was giving these boys something rare in their lives: the wholehearted attention of someone who believed in them.

	5 . As they became better students and chess players, Bill Hall&rsquo;s dreams for them grew. With a little funding supplied by the Manhattan Chess Club, he enrolled, inspired and took them to the State Finals in Syracuse.

	6 . What had been twelve disparate, isolated, often passive, disinterested kids had now been transformed into a team with their own chose name: The Royal Knights.

	7 . Upon finishing third in the State Finals, they were now eligible for the Junior High School National Finals in California.

	8 . By now, disappointingly, even Bill&rsquo;s own colleagues were giving him reasons why he shouldn&rsquo;t be devoting so much time and effort. In real life, these ghetto kids would never "get past New Jersey," as one teacher pronounced. Why raise funds to fly them across the country and render them more dissatisfied with their lives?

	9 . Nonetheless, Bill raised the money for tickets to California. In that national competition, they finished seventeenth out of 109 teams.

	10 . On one of their days at a New York chess club, the team members encountered a young girl from the Soviet Union who was the Women&rsquo;s World Champion.

	11 . Even Bill as astounded by the idea that two of his students proposed: if this girl could travel here all the way from Russia, why couldn&rsquo;t The Royal Knights make the journey there too? After all, it was the chess capital of the world, and the Scholastic Chess Friendship Games were in the offering.

	12 . Though no U.S. players their age had ever entered these games.        

	13 . officials in Bill&rsquo;s school district rallied round the idea.       

	14 . So did a few corporations he approached for travel money.

	15 . Of course, no one thought his team could win.

	16 . but that was not the goal. The trip itself would widen the boys&rsquo; horizons, Bill argued.     

	17 . When Pepsi-Cola produced a $20,000 check, Bill began to realize that his crazy dream was materializing before his very eyes.
