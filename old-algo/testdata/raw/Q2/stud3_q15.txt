Bill had set up a chess club in order to bring the students together and help them learn English as well as chess. He wanted to bridge their cultural boundaries and help them. The student&rsquo;s chess skills and English kept improving. They played matches in various parts of the city. They took part in inter-school competitions and got enrolled in the Manhattan Chess Club. The team eventually managed to reach the state finals and placed third. The once glum kids were now inspired and their confidence grew. In the national competition in California they came in 17 out of 109 teams. Even though no one their age had participated in the Scolastic Friendship Games, Bill argued that despite the unlikelihood of them winning, the trip would increase the boys&rsquo; exposure and he managed to get Pepsi-Cola to sponsor them to take part in the Games held in Russia while representing the USA.
