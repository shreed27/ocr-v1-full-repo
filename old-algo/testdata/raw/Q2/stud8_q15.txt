Bill had set up a chess club in order to 

	bond the students with a common recreation and to improve their English. As such, their English and chess technique were enhanced. As they developed greater finesse in the game Bill brought them to chess matches in schools outside Spanish Harlem. The boys started to trust In Bill and believe in him as he showed them concern and unwavering attention. With merger funding, Bill registered, motivated and took them to the State Finals. What had been twelve different, detached, compliant, dispassionate kids had now been transformed into a team: The Royal Knights. Finishing third in the State Finals, they qualified for the Junior High School National Finals. In that national competition, they finished seventeenth out of 109 teams. Intrigue by the idea of competing in Russia, officials in Bill&rsquo;s school district united round the idea. When Pepsi-Cola produced a $20,000 check, Bill began to realize that he had achieved his dream.
