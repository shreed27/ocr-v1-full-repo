It is not just poor people who live in slums but also richer individuals wanting a cheaper residence in closer proximity to their workplaces. A wide income disparity exists in Indian slums, where certain slums are fully equipped with water, electricity and additional amenities. Slums are operated based on factors such as their race, political ties and their length of establishment. Newer slums are often torn down by the government and lack the infrastructure to prevent fire outbreaks and theft. This is due to the lack of political influence and internal leadership to fight off these instigations. Thus, pradhans need to pull I the right strings in the government to aid their slums and keep them running. Certain tactics can also aid in the preservation of slums, like building a temple to reduce the possibility of governments tearing down slums. New slums occupied by a single race can also gain political influence in return to votes and support.
