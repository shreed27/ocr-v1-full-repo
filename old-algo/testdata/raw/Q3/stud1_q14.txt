It is not just poor people who live in slums but people who are financially stable. Higher class slums have basic amenities but are illegal. Slums are run based on the race population, political networks and the duration of the slum&rsquo;s establishment. Newer slums face problems like the political leader being destroyed by the government or the structure of the buildings are unable to prevent stealing and fires. Pradhans give aid to their community. A previous maid of a mainstream political party&rsquo;s leader ran a slum. The construction of temples prevents the destruction of slums because the police do not usually touch them. Politicians occupy the slums alone to increase votes and supporters at the rallies for themselves to increase their political status.
