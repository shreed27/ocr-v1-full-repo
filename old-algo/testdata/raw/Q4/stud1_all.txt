The bears had lived a life of torture as they were caged since they were young cubs and were released when Robinson unveiled their plight by exposing the cruel scene of bear farming. Investigations also led to a discovery of a ten-year period plan of raising the number of bears in a bid to apply oversea trade which led to international outcry. One of the worst bear farms were also closed down after much effort and the bears were transferred to better care. The bears suffered with infections and injuries on its head from the banging of a cage smaller than the bear itself. Many of the bears bled and had green biles in their abdomens. Bears who had paws were striped of their paws. After seven years of toiling for the bears, an agreement was signed to release these bears and the closure of the worst bear farms. The agreement also ended the bear farming practice in Beijing.
