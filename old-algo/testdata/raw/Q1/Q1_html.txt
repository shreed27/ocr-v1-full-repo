	1.1 . In the context of the essay, scarcity would be defined as limited resources which needs to be managed, because of men&rsquo;s unlimited wants , Choice is an inevitable consequence of scarcity&nbsp; which is the need to answer the four question&nbsp; of&nbsp; what to produce&nbsp; , how and how much to produce&nbsp; and&nbsp; for whom .<br />
	<br />
	1.2 . The definition of opportunity cost would be defined as the cost arising from using limited resources to satisfy unlimited wants in terms of the next best alternative foregone . It is a consequence of choice.<br />
	<br />
	2 . A production possibilities curve (PPC) is a curve which represents the maximum combination of 2 goods an economy can produce, under a specified timeframe, given a specific level of technology and under the assumption that all resource are fully and efficiently utilized.<br />
	<br />
	3 . The PPC can be used to effectively elucidate the meaning of scarcity , choice and opportunity cost.<br />
	<br />
	4 .&nbsp; As one went from producing from point A to C, it can be seen that choice entails giving up more of one good (A) to produce more of another (C) . From this, we can see society having to choose between 2 goods as the resources used to produce both goods are limited . Choice can be represent by different combinations of goods along the PPC, take for example, there is always a choice to either produce more of product A or product B. A real life example would be the choice of producing either more capital or consumer goods.<br />
	<br />
	5 . Scarcity on the PPC is represented by point E, on the right of the PPC whereby it represents unattainable conditions due to a lack of resources&nbsp; whereas any point on or under the PPC is attainable given the resource base of each country . A real life example would be the limited resource of oil or land . Whereby it cannot satisfy men&rsquo;s unlimited want for it, thus there are rising prices for these limited resources.&nbsp; Point on the PPC represent efficient use of resources for that much of production of goods.<br />
	<br />
	6 . Opportunity cost&nbsp; can be identified on the PPC by its gradient , as one moves to the production of more consumer goods as seen in the diagram. The gradient from point &ldquo;A to B is not as steep as the gradient from B to C . It can be seen in the diagram that by producing more of consumer goods, the opportunity cost would be the forgoing of capital goods. This concave shaped of the PPC , relative to the origin,&nbsp; demonstrates the law of increasing opportunity cost, whereby to produce an equal amounts of another good, society must sacrifice an ever increasing amount of the other good. A real life example would be the production of the consumer good whereby the opportunity cost would be forgoing the production of capital goods.</p>
