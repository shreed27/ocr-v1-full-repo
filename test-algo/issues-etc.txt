Issues with algorithm code:
- vastly underdocumented
- tests in test.py don't check results (i.e., cases just run as examples)
- no assert's in the code(i.e., lack of sanity checks)
- module interface is not clean (spaghetti interactions)
- convoluted data structures (oveuse of hashes for passing around information)
- excessive use of generators in scheme parser (in scheme_lang.py)
- test code uses customized version of classes (i.e., not testing entirely against production system)
- most test cases ignored due to "taking too much time"
- a bunch of obsolete code
- keyword match overlap not factored into score
- document frequency based on key not student text
- student sentences can be matched more than once
